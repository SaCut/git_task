##### What are the stages of git on local host?
- The three stages of git on a local host are:
	- *Untracked*, when a file or files have been edited on the local machine
	- *Staged*, when the edited files are added to the local git version and tagget with a commit
	- *Committed*, when the files have been pushed to the GitHub repository and the local and remote versions match.
